# WeatherApplication

This sample shows how to fetch current and 7-day weather information from the OpenWeatherMap API using Jetpack Compose.

## Setup
1. Get an API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api).
2. Open `ApiClient.kt` and replace `"YOUR_API_KEY"` with your API key.
3. Build and run the project using Android Studio.

The main screen displays the current temperature with the weather icon and shows a row of daily forecasts with icons.
