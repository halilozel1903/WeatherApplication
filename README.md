# WeatherApplication

This sample shows how to fetch a 5 day / 3 hour weather forecast from the OpenWeatherMap API using Jetpack Compose.

## Setup
1. Get an API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api).
2. Open `ApiClient.kt` and replace `"YOUR_API_KEY"` with your API key.
3. Build and run the project using Android Studio.

The app now shows a list of sample cities from around the world. Selecting a city opens
its 5 day / 3 hour forecast complete with weather icons.
